# Winamp-AlienFX-Plugin
A visualization plugin for Winamp that uses the AlienFX device to display beats. Added support for newer models and made some new changes with overall improvements. Original work by Ingrater.

Because the original dev made this plugin back in 2009, currently it only supports winamp but I would love if people can help me out so it can work whenever it detects audio from any stream.

This should work for Alienware 15 R3/17 R4 and newer models. Haven't tested it yet on older models but original plugin still works so you can use that.

Instructions:
1. Download the zip from link below and paste the vis_winamp-alienfx-plugin to your Winamp Plugin directory (example: C:\Program Files (x86)\Winamp\Plugins)

2. Copy the xml files to C:\Users\<User>\AppData\Roaming\Winamp\Plugins.

3. Launch Winamp, right click and select Visualizations, select AlienFX plugin and click on start. You can also configure the frequences by clicking on configure button.

Note: if your device ID is different than above models then you will need to change it in alienfx_vis_devices.xml file and similarly LED zones.
