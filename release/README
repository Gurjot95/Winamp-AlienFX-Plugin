WARNING
=======
This plugin is work-in-progress and is neither bug-free nor fully working yet! Use it at your own risk. See LICENSE for details.

INSTALL
=======
copy the libgcc_s_dw2-1.dll to your root Winamp directory (typically C:\Program Files\Winamp
copy the vis_winamp-alienfx-plugin.dll to the Winamp\Plugins directory
copy the alienfx_vis_config.xml to your appdata\Winamp\Plugins directory (C:\Users\Your Username\appdata\Roaming\Winamp\Plugins for Vista and 7).
	Note that the appdata folder is a hidden folder.  You must enable hidden files and folders in order to find it!

INITIAL CONFIGURE
=================
Currently there is one value "delay" which can only be changed by editing the vis_alienfx_config.xml. The descriptions for this values are
in the xml file.

STARTUP
=======
Open Winamp.  Go to preferences, then Visualization.  "Alienfx Visualization plugin" should be displayed as a choice.
Click it and click "Start."  NOTE - on initial opening, you will see an error about a missing file.  Hit OK and ignore it.
The plugin will now create a settings xml file to go along with the config xml file you copied earlier.

CONFIGURING WHILE RUNNING WINAMP
================================
Hit Alt + K in order to bring up the configuration window.  You will see a series of sliders and a few boxes.  The sliders represent
different frequencies - lower frequencies (bass) to the left; higher frequencies (treble) to the right.  The two sets of sliders are used
to detect the beat and trigger the LED's.  The trigger will only occur when both Sound Energy and Energy Variance are above the slider.
This will show a color change in the bars from green to red.  This is also displayed in more detail on a popup window.

The next two sliders, Absolute and Relative variance, control the amount of absolute and relative variance which is used to compute beats.
For example, if you set the first slider to 1.0 and the second to 0.0, the resulting variance only consits of absolute variance. Absolute
variance preferes high sound energy which mostly occur in low frequencies. So this is good for detecting bass beats. The relative variance
does not prefer any frequencies and thus outputs the same variance values for all frequecies. Use this to "amp up" the Energy Variance.
Play around with these options - they will take some getting used to!

The bottom of the window is where you will program in your zones.  Click the Add button and then type in a title, such as "speakers."  Next,
highlight the zone and click the Edit button. You can choose one or more frequencies for the zone to monitor.  To do this, click the frequency
and click the < button.  Do the same for the LEDs you want to beat with the frequency.  Finally, choose the color (or check random). Hit close.
Repeat these steps for any and all the LEDs you wish to have controled.  The combinations are endless.

Use the above three paragraphs to help you configure and personalize your plugin.  Do not be frustrated if it does not work right away.
Once you have finished configuring the LED's, click "Save Config."  You may want to do this often just in case of crashes.

SAMPLE CONFIGURATION
====================
Lord_Zath has the following configuration.  While it doesn't work 100%, this may be a good place to start.

Zones

Speakers - left speaker, right speaker, touchpad set to frequency band 1 (bass line).  Blue color.
Keyboard - Keyboard left, Keyboard middle right, Keyboard middle left set to bands 13-16 (mids).  Green color.
Uppers - Alienhead, alienware logo set to bands 29-32.  Red color.
Numbpad - Keyboard right, frequency bands 21-24.  Green color.

Sliders

Sound Energy - 2.04 across the board.
Energy Variance - 52.00 across the board; frequencies 1-4 all the way to 0.
Absolute Variance - 0.00
Relative Variance - 0.50
